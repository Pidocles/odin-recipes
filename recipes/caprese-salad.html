        Caprese salad is an Italian salad, made of sliced fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil, seasoned with
        salt, and olive oil. It is usually arranged on a plate in restaurant practice. Like pizza Margherita, it
        features the colours of the Italian flag: green, white, and red.
