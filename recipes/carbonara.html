        Description
    </h3>
    <p>
        Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its simplicity and rich flavors. It typically consists of
        spaghetti or another type of pasta, mixed with a sauce made from eggs, grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano
        cheese, pancetta or bacon, black pepper, and sometimes garlic. The sauce is created by combining beaten eggs
        with the grated cheese and then tossing it with cooked pasta and crispy pancetta or bacon, which adds a savory
        and slightly smoky taste. The heat from the pasta and pancetta cooks the eggs, creating a creamy and velvety
        texture without the use of cream. The dish is often finished with a generous amount of freshly ground black
        pepper, which adds a sharp and aromatic kick. Carbonara is a comforting and satisfying dish that showcases the
        beauty of simplicity and quality ingredients.

    <h4>
        Ingredients
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti or linguine pasta (around 8 ounces or 225 grams)</li>
        <li>Pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured pork), diced or thinly sliced (about 4 ounces or 115 grams)</li>
        <li>Eggs (3 large eggs)</li>
        <li>Grated Pecorino Romano cheese (about 1 cup or 100 grams)</li>
        <li>Black pepper, freshly ground</li>
        <li>Salt (for seasoning the pasta water and the dish)</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves, minced (optional, but some variations include garlic)</li>
        <li>Italian parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti or linguine according to the package
            instructions until al dente (cooked but still firm to the bite).</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta or guanciale to the
            skillet and cook until it becomes crispy and golden brown. If desired, you can also add minced garlic to the
            skillet and cook it until fragrant.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined. Season with
            freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a small amount of the cooking water. Immediately add the hot
            pasta to the skillet with the pancetta/guanciale. Toss well to combine and coat the pasta with the rendered
            fat.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and let it cool slightly for a minute or two. This step is important to
            ensure that the eggs don't scramble when added to the pasta.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta while continuously tossing and stirring. The residual
            heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the mixture appears too thick, you can
            add a small amount of the reserved pasta water to thin it out slightly.</li>
        <li>Taste the carbonara and season with salt if needed. Remember that the pancetta or guanciale and Pecorino
            Romano cheese are already salty, so be cautious with the additional salt.</li>
        <li>Serve the carbonara immediately while it's hot. Garnish with freshly chopped Italian parsley, if desired.
            Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
